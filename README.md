# Techdegree_Unit2_Project
I have been given a list of teams and players. I've been tasked with cleaning up the player data and then organizing the players into equal teams for the upcoming basketball season.

This tool will not only balance the teams by the total number of players but also let me generate some statistics for a given team.
